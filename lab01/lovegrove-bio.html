            Hi, my name is Amanda Lovegrove. I am majoring in Information Management & Technology interested in studying cybersecurity. My accomplishments so far in my college career are earning a spot on the deans list for both fall 2020 and spring 2021. I currently have experience coding using java, html, and python.
	        Outside of work I enjoy hanging out with friends, reading, photography, and going to the gym. Some of my favorite movies are legally blonde and any marvel movie. I live in Darien, CT and have 2 older brothers.
