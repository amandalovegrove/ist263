    <h1>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
<div class="paragraph1">
    <p>
        Not everyone is the next Alan Turing or Elon Musk. Some of us don’t even know what Artificial Intelligence entails. But don’t worry, by the end of this page you will know exactly what Artificial intelligence is, what it’s trying to accomplish, and how it works. So keep reading to be the next AI expert!

        So, what does artificial intelligence entail? To begin, the purpose of artificial intelligence is to use machines to recreate tasks that humans can do on their own. </p>

        Teslas are a great example of this. As you may know already Teslas are high tech cars with many interesting features. One of these features is autopilot (self- driving). Autopilot falls under the category of artificial intelligence because it uses technology to think like a human, problem solve, and navigate the road so you don’t have to. Tesla owners can use this feature to take a break from driving on the road. Autopilot requires the car to think like a human by following the rules of the road, problem solve by figuring out when to brake or merge lanes and navigate the road by using its technology and programming. This is a obvious example of AI. However, there are so many machines we use on the daily that you might not know are considered AI. A good example of this is google maps. Personally, I am horrible at directions. I use Google maps or Waze anytime I need to drive somewhere out of my town. People use these apps every day to go to work, get to a restaurant, or pick up a friend. These apps use real time data to measure traffic and decide the fastest routes. These functions are AI. They problem solve and interpret data just like you! The fact that these small programs are AI can be surprising to people who do not know much about the topic. Most people tend to base their knowledge of AI on movies and books who depict it as robots who do our chores or clean our houses. And although it seems crazy, those types of robots are not far fetched from what AI can do.
            For the most part, I’ve been explaining AI as something we use  every day. Although we do use many AI machines everyday there are also so many more machines that we don’t use. These machines are typically used by big companies who need to do large tasks and can save time doing them using artificial intelligence. One way AI is used by big companies is in agriculture.

            Agriculture makes up a huge part of our economy. People depend on farmers and large harvesters to be on time with their deliveries and have the best quality they can get. This is too much work for everyday employees to do. In addition, it might require way too many paychecks for a company to hire the number of workers it takes for this work to get done. So, these big farming companies use AI to make sure our vegetables are grown well and delivered to our grocery stores on time. Some of the way agriculture is taking advantage of AI is by using it to measure real time data. These sets of data include weather, temperature, water usage, and soil conditions.
            This information can help famers make more informed decisions on how to treat their crops. Then in turn, it leads to better tasting and fresher fruits and vegetables or whatever they may be growing. In addition, AI sensors can detect weeds or pests taking residence on their crops. There are so many ways we can use AI to simplify our lives and save time from petty tasks. Even if you are just planning to use AI machines for everyday use or for wide scale purposes, AI can help everyone!
