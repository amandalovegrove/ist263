    <h1>Where is Artificial Intelligence Going?</h1>

    <p>
        So now you know what Artificial intelligence is and how we are using it, but now the question is; where is the future of AI headed? There are so many directions that artificial intelligence is headed. From anywhere to kitchen appliances to rockets, it’s not secret AI is going to be a huge part of our future. One big advancement I find interesting is Elon Musk’s “Tesla bot” that he recently introduced to the world last month. These humanlike robots are going to make everyday tasks you dread doing much easier.

        Musk said that these robots could go to the grocery store for you and do any type of manual labor. The technology these robots use would be much like the programs used in teslas autopilot feature except navigating the road it would navigate seas of pedestrians and your house. However, many people are scared at the thought of a future where robots walk among us. This is a valid fear. I mean, weve all seen the movies and read the stories of robots taking over the world. However, it may not be one of the biggest worries you have after l tell you more about the pros and cons of the future of AI.

        There are many things to discuss regarding our future with Artificial Intelligence. In my opinion, the pros outweigh the cons. Some of the main benefits of advancing AI are increasing accuracy, accomplishing tasks we thought were impossible, and saving time. Machines using artificial intelligence programs can be used to do tasks that the average human cannot do without making mistakes. For example, say your pipes break under your sink. Perhaps in the future a machine much like the tesla bot could be used to fix your pipes, clean your gutters, or fix your Wi-Fi. Not only would you no longer have to pay for a handyman, but chances are based on accuracy and equations used in programming, a machine could do a much better, long-lasting job than a human. In addition, since these machines are programmed similarly to computers, who knows what they will be able to accomplish. There are many mathematic equations that could be solved with the knowledge of multiple computers that are able to think and problem solve like humans (but better!). Lastly, as mentioned before Musk states that these Bots could go to grocery stores for you, imagine the time you could save if you didn’t have to do small tasks throughout your day. If I had a chance to interact with these new machines I would be very interested in their limits, I assume they could do my homework or correct my problems. These are just some of the amazing benefits of AI.

        However, everything comes with a price. Some cons of AI are potential job loss and losing control. Its pretty obvious if we keep developing in the way we are, robots and machines will be doing most of our jobs in the future. Many human jobs have already been replaced by machines. Amazon for example uses a lot of machines, cutting their human employee population in half. I would be surprised if we even still hired cashiers in the future. Lastly, the biggest concern is losing control. Although it seems more like a science fiction movie, losing control of robots is a big concern. If hackers can hack social media accounts, computers, or even cars then what stops them from hacking into tesla bots? Losing control of such a powerful machine could lead to a lot of dangerous problems. There are so many things that are unknown about our future, especially in AI. I’m so intrigued to see where this all brings us into the future and how it will change our world as we know it.
